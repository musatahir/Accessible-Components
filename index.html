        <p>Dropdown menus are a common UI element used to present different choices to a user in a compact space,
            Although they are used widely
            across the web, their usability and accessibility can vary significantly. Some are smooth and intuitive, while others feel like a 
            puzzle you never signed up for. Netflix‚Äôs genre dropdown, for example, disables itself after selection, making it frustrating for users who want to switch categories. 
            In this case study, we will
            compare different instances of dropdown
            menus across applications, analyzing their input and output features. Then, we will examine Netflix's genre
            dropdown menu more closely
            by creating state diagrams that model user interaction. Finally, based on our analysis, we will propose a
            redesign of Netflix's genre dropdown menu to
            enhance its usability and accessibility.

            understand
            their current state. This section summarizes how each of the three applications communicates state changes
            through visual cues, text updates,
            and screen reader focus order. For Netflix, note that a static textbox (not available for interaction) of
            the selected genre replaced the dropdown menu once a genre was selected,
            effectively disabling it. I found this behavior strange, as it limited the user's ability to easily change
            their selection.

        <p>We now use the following state diagrams to examine our Netflix genre dropdown menu component more closely.
            Let's first
            model the dropdown's state for mouse and keyboard users as it is currently implemented i.e, unrevised.
        </p>

            <img src="images/unrevised.png" alt="Unrevised Netflix dropdown state model for mouse/keyboard users">

        <p>As seen above, we notice some issues with the current state model. Notice how it isn't possible to navigate
            throughthe dropdown menu using the keyboard alone.
            It is also inconvenient how the dropdown menu becomes disabled once a genre is selected, which strains the
            user's ability to change their selection efficiently.
            To see what type of interactions the model above is capturing, watch the video below of a user interacting
            with the Netflix genre dropdown menu.

        <p> Let's now model the revised state for mouse and keyboard users. This revised model will address the
            gaps we identified in the previous model. Importantly, this model allows users to reopen the dropdown to
            change
            their selection after one has been made. Also notice how the revised model allows for keyboard navigation
            and includes a
            clear "X" button to close the dropdown.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Based on  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iccWRhKZa8&t=185s" target="_blank">Kat Holmes‚Äô talk</a> on Inclusive Design, we will now reflect on this case study and the impacts of our 
            proposed design choices. In terms of accessibility and usability, both Microsoft Word's font menu and Apple Music's 
            three-bar menu fully support keyboard navigation and provide hover highlights for clear visual feedback. A major mismatch
             I noticed is that the original Netflix‚Äôs dropdown‚Äôs lack of keyboard support, implicitly assuming interactions are mouse-based. 
             Another mismatch manifests when the dropdown becomes inactive after selection, restricting users who may need to switch genres 
             frequently or motor impaired users who may struggle to efficiently reopen the menu.  Furthermore, Netflix lacks an obvious dropdown 
             closing or collapsing affordance. In contrast, Microsoft Word‚Äôs dropdown menu‚Äôs autocomplete feature improves accessibility, 
             allowing users with limited dexterity to type instead of scrolling. Our redesign addresses these by ensuring continuous 
             interactivity, clear focus states, and improved keyboard support. I added keyboard functionality (refer to state models) and an 
             "X" button (refer to component redesign) to improve usability, especially for assistive technology users. While mouse and mobile 
             users are often prioritized in design, keyboard and screen reader users are less prioritized and at times even neglected. This project highlights how 
             designing with accessibility in mind benefits all users, creating a superior experience for everyone.
